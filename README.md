# AI RADAR: Overview
AI RADAR is an advanced AI-driven platform designed to monitor and analyze the software development lifecycle in real-time. It acts as a "radar" for detecting vulnerabilities, modeling threats, and predicting potential exploits based on existing code, development processes, and historical data. By integrating with Git repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and security tools, it provides developers, security engineers, and DevOps teams with actionable insights to build secure-by-design applications. The system combines backend architecture, machine learning models, and data pipelines to identify risks such as code vulnerabilities, anomalous patterns, and attack vectors, ultimately enhancing software security and compliance.
